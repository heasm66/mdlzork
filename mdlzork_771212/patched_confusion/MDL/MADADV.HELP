Useful commands

    The 'brief' command suppresses printing of long room descriptions
for rooms which have been visited.  The 'unbrief' command turns this
off.  The 'superbrief' command suppresses printing of long room
descriptions for all rooms; 'unsup' turns this off.
    The 'info' command prints a file which might give some idea of
what the game is about.
    The 'quit' command (or ctrl-G) prints your score, and asks whether
you wish to continue playing.
    The 'script', 'unscript', 'save', and 'restore' commands are
useful if you are a local user.  
Dungeon Command Parser
    
    A command is one line of text terminated by a carriage return.
For reasons of simplicity all words are distinguished by their first
five letters.  All others are ignored.  For example, your typing
'DISASSEMBLE THE ENCYLOPEDIA' while meaningless is also creating
excess effort for your fingers.  Note also that ambiguities can be
introduced by this:  'unscr' is 'UNSCRipt', not 'UNSCRew'.

    You are talking to a fairly stupid parser, which understands the
following types of things.

 Actions:       
    Among the more obvious of these, TAKE, DROP, etc.  Fairly general
    forms of these may be used:  PICK UP, PUT DOWN, etc.

 Directions:
    NORTH, SOUTH, UP, DOWN, etc. and their various abbreviations.
    Other more obscure directions (LAND, CLIMB) are appropriate in
    only certain situations.
    
 Objects: 
    Most objects have names, and can be referenced by them.

 Adjectives:
    Some adjectives are understood and are required when there are
    two objects which can be referenced with the same 'name' (e.g.
    DOORs, BUTTONs)

 Prepositions:
    It may be necessary in some cases to include prepositions, but
    the parser attempts to handle cases which aren't ambiguous
    without.  Thus 'Give car to demon' will work, as will 'Give demon
    car.'  'Give car demon' probably won't do anything interesting. 
    When a preposition is used, it should be appropriate:  'Give car
    with demon' does not parse.

 Sentences:

    The parser understands a reasonable number of things.  Rather
    than listing them, we advise you to do reasonable things.

 Ambiguity:

    The parser tries to be clever about what to do in the case of
    actions which require objects in the case that the object is not
    specified.  If there is only one possible object, the parser will
    assume that it should be used.  Otherwise, the parser will ask.
    Most questions asked by the parser can be answered (e.g. With
    what?).
         
  Inventory:  Lists the objects in your possession.

  Look: Prints a description of your surroundings.

  Containment:  

     Some objects can contain other objects.  Many such containers can
     be opened and closed; the rest are always open.  They may or may
     not be transparent.  For you to access (take, for example) an
     object which is in a container, the container must be open; for you
     to see such an object, the container must either be open or
     transparent.  Containers have a capacity, and objects have sizes;
     the number of objects which will fit therefore depends on their
     sizes.  You may "put" any object you have access to (it need not be
     in your hands) into any other object; at some point, the program
     will attempt to pick it up if you don't already have it, which
     process may fail if you're carrying too much.  Although  containers
     can contain other containers, the program doesn't access more than
     one level down.

  Fighting:

     Occupants of the dungeon will, as a rule, fight back when
     attacked; they may in some cases attack you unprovoked.  Useful
     verbs here are 'attack <villain> with <weapon>', 'kill', etc. 
     Knife-throwing may or may not be useful.  The adventurer has a
     fighting strength, which varies with time:  in particular, being
     in a fight, getting killed, and getting injured, all lower it. 
     One's carrying capacity may also be reduced after a fight. 
     Strength is regained with time.  (Thus, it is not a good idea to
     fight someone immediately after being killed.)  Other details
     may become apparent in the course of a few melees.  The
     'diagnose' command describes your state of health.
